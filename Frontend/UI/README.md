The dashboard features a collapsible sidebar navigation and a modern top navbar with user profile and notification functionality.

The dashboard implements all the required tabs (Sessions, Receipts, Chat, Logs) with high-quality placeholder content styled with Tailwind CSS. Each tab provides appropriate data visualization and interactive elements relevant to their purpose.

The interface uses smooth transitions and subtle animations to enhance usability while maintaining professional aesthetics. The layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes while preserving functionality. You can test the role switching functionality by clicking on your profile picture in the top right and selecting "Switch to Mentor" or "Switch to Admin".
